        <para>Cyrus IMAP is a powerful, modular piece of software.  Power
            and modularity entails a certain degree of complexity.  </para>

        <section>
            <title>Filesystem Layout</title>

            <para>Like most applications, a Cyrus IMAP installation has a
            number of files, such as data files for messages, program files for
            subservers, configuration files, etc.  Unfortunately, the default
            locations for these files are at odds with the Linux Filesystem
            Heirarchy Standard and depending on whether you installed from
            source or installed from a package made by someone else, your
            files could have one of several different locations.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Mail Spool</title>

                <para>The mail spool is typically located in
                <filename>/var/spool/mail</filename>.  This one fact remains
                fairly consistent.  Below here, there may be three different
                sorts of layouts, depending the selected level of mailbox
                hashing.  If <literal>hashimapspool</literal> is zero,
                then there will just be directories here that map directly
                to mailboxes based on the first letter of the mailbox name.
                For example, a mailbox for user "wcooley" will be located
                at <filename>/var/spool/mail/w/user/wcooley</filename>.
                For very large installations, however, this tends to result
                in a disproporationate number of mailboxes under "s" compared
                with "z."</para>

                <para>If <literal>hashimapspool</literal> is 1 or true, then
                the effect of <literal>fulldirhash</literal> comes into play.
                If it is not set or zero, then mailboxes are set by the
                username.  For example, for user "wcooley", the mailbox is
                located in <filename>/var/spool/mail/w/user/wcooley</filename>.
                However, if <literal>fulldirhash</literal> is set
                to <literal>1</literal> or <literal>true</literal>,
                then the mailbox directories are hashed with a true
                hash function to a prime number "buckets," which
                are represented as a single character.  For example,
                <filename>/var/spool/imap/I/user/wcooley</filename>.  The use
                of a true hash function provides nearly even distribution
                of mailboxes in into directories.</para>

                <para>To provide a consistent lookup mechanism for mailbox
                names, the <filename>mbpath</filename> program is provided to
                allow a consistent interface for determining the actual mailbox
                path without having to account for the hashing yourself.</para>

                <para>The <command>dohash</command> and
                <command>undohash</command> scripts purport to convert
                between the three levels of mailbox hashing.  However, they
                may not work and are not terribly well documented, so it's
                probably best to choose the correct one from the beginning.
                Unless you plan on mucking about with the mailboxes (which
                you probably should not do), there is no harm in using the
                full hashing from the get-go.</para>

            <section>
                <title><command>master</command></title>

                <para>The <command>master</command> process acts as
                the controller for all of the Cyrus sub-servers.
                It performs tasks similar to those performed by
                <command>cron</command>, <command>inetd</command>, and
                init scripts, although only for Cyrus processes--it is
                not a system-wide replacement for any of these.  It is
                configured through the <filename>cyrus.conf</filename>
                file, which has three sections: <literal>START</literal>,
                <literal>SERVICES</literal>, and
                <literal>EVENTS</literal>.</para>

                <para>Each section has entries which are restricted to a
                single line and composed of a tag name and parameters.
                The tag name should be unique and the exact parameters
                are specific to the particular section.  When Cyrus is
                built with support for TCP Wrappers, the tag name is used
                as the daemon name for <filename>hosts.allow</filename>
                and <filename>hosts.deny</filename>.</para>

                <para>All sections have a <parameter>cmd</parameter>, which
                lists the program and parameters to be used when the entry
                is invoked.  This entry is relative to the <parameter
                class="command">--with-cyrus-prefix</parameter> supplied
                at build time.</para>

                <para>The <literal>START</literal> section contains
                commands that are run then <literal>master</literal> is
                started, much like an init script.  Usually, this section
                contains nothing more than a <parameter>recover</parameter>
                section, for checking the Cyrus databases before starting
                processes that use those databases.  If your system is
                configured to use <literal>idled</literal>, it is also
                started here, because it does not directly listen on a
                network or UNIX socket.</para>

                <para>The following is a minimal listing of the
                <literal>START</literal> section (taken from the example
                <filename>master/conf/normal.conf</filename> from the
                source distribution).
<programlisting>START {
  # do not delete this entry!
  recover       cmd="ctl_cyrusdb -r"
                                                                                                                                                                     
  # this is only necessary if using idled for IMAP IDLE
#  idled                cmd="idled"
}
</programlisting> 
                </para>

                <para>The <literal>SERVICES</literal> section contains
                entries for the various sub-servers that run under the
                system and listen on network sockets.  It is very much
                like <command>inetd</command> in this respect.  </para>

                <note> <para>Older versions of Cyrus (1.5 and
                1.6) required <command>inetd</command> entries for
                sub-servers.  In 2.0 and later versions, this section of
                <filename>cyrus.conf</filename> replaces that.  If you
                find documentation referring to <command>inetd</command>,
                your documentation is obsolete!  </para> </note>

                <para>The <parameter>listen</parameter> parameter lists the
                TCP or UDP port or UNIX domain socket to be listened-on
                for the particular service.  UNIX domain sockets are
                paths in the filesystem and are differentiated from
                ports by starting with a slash (<literal>/</literal>).
                For TCP and UDP sockets, you can give either the
                actual port number or the service name, as resolved
                through <filename>/etc/services</filename> or other
                NSS means.  TCP is the default protocol, although UDP
                can be used with the <parameter>proto</parameter> parameter.
                <parameter>prefork</parameter> and <parameter>maxchild</parameter>
                provide control over the number of processes initially
                forked to help manage load and the maximum number of child
                processes to be started, to prevent too many processes from
                overloading the system.  The <parameter>maxfds</parameter>
                parameter limits the number of open file handles that
                the each process my have open.</para>

                <para>The following is an example listing of the
                <literal>SERVICES</literal> (taken from the example

                convert between the various database formats used by Cyrus.
                It can be used, for example, to perform a dump of data from
                binary databases to plain-text flat-file databases, which
                can be more reliably backed-up.</para>

                <title>deliver</title>

                <para>The <command>deliver</command> command used to be
                the point of entry for mail coming from the mail transfer
                agent (Sendmail, Postfix, etc).  It reads messages from
                standard input and delivers into the system.  However, with
                the implementation of LMTP, it is considered obsolete.
                In fact, it is just an LMTP client which delivers to
                <command>lmtpd</command>.  It should not be used by the
                MTA to deliver mail into the system unless the MTA does not
                support LMTP.  It can still be useful, however, with external
                programs such as <command>procmail</command>, which does not
                operate as an LMTP client.  (FIXME: procmail has an option
                now to be an LMTP client.)  The <parameter>-q</parameter>
                may still be useful to post over-quota alerts to users'
                mailboxes.</para>

                command used for viewing filesystem quotas, this command
                reports on quota usage and can also be used to repair
                inconsistencies. (NB: The Cyrus <command>quota</command>
                command is in section 8 of the man pages; the filesystem

                to rebuild mailboxes, which might have suffered database
                corruption or restored from backup.  Note that, despite the
                fact that the man page has listed a <parameter>-m</parameter>
                option to rebuild the master mailbox list, it has never
                actually worked.  It is important, therefore, to maintain
                a backup of the mailbox list, perferably as plain-text.</para>
