        <title>Protocol Logging</title>

        <para>As a debugging aid, Cyrus IMAP can also log protocol
            conversations on a per-user basis.  Note that you cannot debug
            the authentication process using this, because the protocol
            logging is only associated with a username and until a user has
            been successfully authenticated, the username is unknown.</para>

        <para>To enable protocol logging, simply create a directory in
            <filename>/var/lib/imap/log</filename> with the user's name you
            wish to log.  Ensure, of course, that this directory is writable by
            the user Cyrus runs as.  Cyrus will create files in this directory
            with the name of the process ID under which it runs (which changes
            per connection due to the forking server model it uses).</para>

        <para>I've created the directory and now I'm logging in with a mail
        client, which selects my INBOX, checks messages and ACLs and logs
        out.</para>
